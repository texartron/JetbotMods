I up loaded my Grill and Belly Pan files for anyone to enjoy.
They are tested to match the Jetbot Chassis perfectly or with just a bit of sanding.

Also loaded here is the sliced up Jetbot chassis files. I used Fusion 360 to make the very calculated cuts from the chassis file.

Well my printer needs a lot of babysitting to get a fully finished part so I had to slice it up into a more manageable bite sizes to print them. I think the full printed part with my settings was going to be 23 hours. I was able to get it to 5 sections with no greater print time than 7 hours. And it really is no big deal to glue them together. There are small holes where the parts join. Where I put a matching pin of plastic to make a strong joint.

The other big advantage... Very little supports have to be printed. Just orient the part in your slicer with the flat side down.

I am not associated with Nvidia in any way and the files are open source, and not for sale.

Thank you Jetbot creators and developers for such an awesome job to inspire the robot community with!
