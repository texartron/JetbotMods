I up loaded my Grill and Belly Pan files for anyone to enjoy.
They are tested to match the Jetbot Chassis perfectly or with just a bit of sanding.

Also loaded here is the sliced up Jetbot chassis files.

Well my printer needs a lot of babysitting to get a fully finished part so I had to slice it up into a more manageable bite sizes to print them. I think the full printed part with my settings was going to be 23 hours. I was able to get it to 5 sections. And it really is no big deal to glue them together. There small holes where the parts join. I put a matching pin of plastic to make a strong joint.

The other big advantage is there is very little supports that have to be printed.

I am not associated with Nvidia in any way and this is open and not for sale.
